"an image field with the same parameters on another content type, you "
"can add the same field to the second content type, in the <em>Add "
"existing field</em> area of the user interface. You could also add "
"this field to a taxonomy vocabulary, comments, user accounts, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some settings of a reused field are unique to each use of the field; "
"others are shared across all places you use the field. For example, "
"the label of a text field is unique to each use, while the setting for "
"the number of values is shared."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two main reasons for reusing fields. First, reusing fields "
"can save you time over defining new fields. Second, reusing fields "
"also allows you to display, filter, group, and sort content together "
"by field across content types. For example, the contributed Views "
"module allows you to create lists and tables of content. So if you use "
"the same field on multiple content types, you can create a View "

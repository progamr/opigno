"</p>\n"
"<strong>Syntax tips:</strong><ul>\n"
"  <li>Use a comma separated list to allow several HTML elements. "
"Example: &quot;em,strong,br,p,ul,ol,li&quot;. Note that you can split "
"your definitions using any number of lines.</li>\n"
"  <li>Use square brackets &quot;[]&quot; to specify the attributes "
"that are allowed for each HTML element. Attributes should be "
"whitelisted explicitly, otherwise element attributes will be ignored. "
"Example: &quot;a&quot; will NOT allow users to post links, you should "
"use &quot;a[href]&quot; instead!</li>\n"
"  <li>Use the vertical bar character &quot;|&quot; to separate several "
"attribute definitions for a single HTML element. Example: "
"&quot;a[href|target]&quot; means users may optionally specify the "
"&quot;href&quot; and &quot;target&quot; attributes for &quot;a&quot; "
"elements, any other attribute will be ignored.</li>\n"
"  <li>Use the exclamation mark &quot;!&quot; to set one attribute as "
"being required for a particular HTML element. Example: "
"&quot;a[!href|target]&quot; means users must specify the "
"&quot;href&quot; attribute, otherwise the whole &quot;a&quot; element "
"will be ignored. Users may optionally specify the &quot;target&quot; "
"attribute as well. However, any other attribute will be "
"ignored.</li>\n"
"  <li>Use the asterisk symbol &quot;*&quot; to whitelist all possible "
"attributes for a particular HTML element. Example: &quot;a[*]&quot; "
"means users will be allowed to use any attribute for the &quot;a&quot; "
"element.</li>\n"
"  <li>Use the at sign character &quot;@&quot; to whitelist a common "
"set of attributes for all allowed HTML elements. Example: "
"&quot;@[class|style]&quot; means users will be allowed to use the "
"&quot;class&quot; and &quot;style&quot; attributes for any whitelisted "
"HTML element.</li>\n"
"  <li>For further information and examples, please consult "
"documentation of the <a href=\"@valid-elements\">valid_elements</a> "
"option in the TinyMCE Wiki site.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<strong>Additional notes:</strong><ul>\n"
"  <li>The following elements cannot be whitelisted due to security "
"reasons, to prevent users from breaking site layout and/or to avoid "
"posting invalid HTML. Forbidden elements: %elements-blacklist.</li>\n"
"  <li>JavaScript event attributes such as onclick, onmouseover, etc. "
"are always ignored. Should you need them, please consider using the "
"&quot;Full HTML&quot; input format instead.</li>\n"
"  <li>If you allow usage of the attributes &quot;id&quot;, "
